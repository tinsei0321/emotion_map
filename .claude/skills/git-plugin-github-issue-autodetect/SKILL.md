# GitHub Issue Auto-Detection

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use the alternative when... |
|---|---|
| Suggesting `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N` keywords from staged-diff content | Use `git-commit-workflow` for the broader commit message style |
| Matching diff hunks against open issues by file path or label | Use `github-issue-writing` to author or restructure the issue body itself |
| Inferring proper issue linkage before composing a commit message | Use `git-issue-hierarchy` for parent/child sub-issue and dependency links |
| Adding closing keywords mechanically based on issue metadata | Use `git-commit-trailers` for trailer-style metadata (Co-authored-by, Release-As) |

Expert guidance for automatically detecting GitHub issues that staged changes may fix or close, ensuring proper issue linkage in commit messages.

## Core Expertise

- **Issue Detection**: Match staged changes to open issues
- **Keyword Selection**: Choose appropriate closing vs reference keywords
- **Context Analysis**: Parse issue titles, bodies, and labels for relevance
- **File Path Matching**: Correlate changed files to issue descriptions

## Detection Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Open Issues

```bash
# Get open issues with relevant metadata (using gh CLI)
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels --limit 50

# Or filter by specific labels for targeted detection
gh issue list --state open --label bug --json number,title,body
gh issue list --state open --label enhancement --json number,title,body
```

### Step 2: Analyze Staged Changes

```bash
# Get list of changed files
git diff --cached --name-only

# Get detailed diff for content analysis
git diff --cached

# Get summary of changes
git diff --cached --stat
```

### Step 3: Match Issues to Changes

Analyze staged changes against issues using these heuristics:

| Signal | Weight | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| File path in issue body | High | Issue mentions `src/auth/login.ts`, diff includes that file |
| Error message match | High | Issue title contains error text found in diff |
| Component/scope match | Medium | Issue labeled `auth`, changes are in `src/auth/` |
| Keyword overlap | Medium | Issue mentions "login", diff modifies login logic |
| Function name match | Medium | Issue references `validateToken()`, diff modifies it |

### Detection Algorithm

```
For each staged file:
  1. Extract file path components (directory, filename, extension)
  2. Extract modified function/class names from diff
  3. Extract error messages or string literals from diff

For each open issue:
  1. Parse title for keywords, file references, error messages
  2. Parse body for code snippets, file paths, stack traces
  3. Check labels for component/area tags

Score each (file, issue) pair:
  - +3 points: Exact file path match
  - +2 points: Error message or function name match
  - +1 point: Directory/component match
  - +1 point: Keyword overlap (>2 significant words)

Report issues with score >= 2 as potential matches
```

## Keyword Selection Guide

### Closing Keywords (Auto-Close on Merge)

Use when the commit **fully resolves** the issue:

| Keyword | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `Fixes #N` | Bug fixes - something was broken, now it works |
| `Closes #N` | Feature completion - requested feature is implemented |
| `Resolves #N` | General resolution - issue is addressed |

### Reference Keywords (Link Without Closing)

Use when the commit **relates to** but doesn't fully resolve:

| Keyword | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `Refs #N` | Partial progress toward issue |
| `Related to #N` | Tangentially related changes |
| `See #N` | Context or discussion reference |
| `Part of #N` | One of multiple commits for an issue |

### Not a keyword: blocking / blocked-by

`Blocks #N` and `Blocked by #N` are *relationships*, not commit trailers —
GitHub does not parse them from commit messages. If the detected issue is a
hard blocker for (or blocked by) the current work, record that through
`/git:issue-hierarchy --blocked-by N` (native dependencies API) rather than
adding a line to the commit footer. Keep commit trailers limited to the
closing/reference keywords above.

### Decision Tree

```
Is this commit the FINAL fix for the issue?
├─ YES → Is it a bug fix?
│        ├─ YES → Use "Fixes #N"
│        └─ NO → Use "Closes #N"
└─ NO → Does it make progress on the issue?
         ├─ YES → Use "Refs #N"
         └─ NO → Use "Related to #N" or omit
```

## Common Patterns

### Bug Fix Detection

```bash
# Issue: "Login fails with 'invalid token' error"
# Staged changes in: src/auth/token.ts

# Detection signals:
# - File path: src/auth/* matches "Login" context
# - Error message: "invalid token" may appear in diff
# - Issue label: bug

# Suggested: Fixes #123
```

### Feature Implementation Detection

```bash
# Issue: "Add dark mode support"
# Staged changes in: src/theme/dark-mode.ts, src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx

# Detection signals:
# - New files with relevant names
# - Issue label: enhancement
# - Keywords: "dark mode", "theme"

# Suggested: Closes #456
```

### Partial Work Detection

```bash
# Issue: "Refactor authentication system"
# Staged changes in: src/auth/oauth.ts (but more work needed)

# Detection signals:
# - File path matches scope
# - Issue is large (multiple sub-tasks in body)
# - Other files mentioned in issue not yet changed

# Suggested: Refs #789
```

## Integration Commands

### Quick Issue Scan Before Commit

```bash
# One-liner to show relevant issues for staged changes
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 20 | \
  jq -r '.[] | "#\(.number): \(.title)"'
```

### Detailed Issue Analysis

```bash
# Get full issue details for matching
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,assignees

# Search issues by keyword
gh issue list --search "keyword in:title,body" --state open
```

### File-Based Issue Search

```bash
# Search for issues mentioning specific file
gh issue list --search "filename.ts in:body" --state open

# Search for issues mentioning directory
gh issue list --search "src/auth in:body" --state open
```

## Agentic Optimizations

| Context | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Quick issue list | `gh issue list --state open --json number,title -L 20` |
| Bug issues only | `gh issue list --state open --label bug --json number,title` |
| Search by keyword | `gh issue list --search "keyword" --state open --json number,title` |
| Full issue detail | `gh issue view N --json title,body,labels` |

## Output Format for Agent

When reporting detected issues, use this format:

```
Detected potentially related issues:

HIGH CONFIDENCE:
- #123 "Login fails with invalid token" → Fixes #123
  Match: File path src/auth/token.ts, error message match

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:
- #456 "Improve auth error handling" → Refs #456
  Match: Directory src/auth/, keyword "error"

Suggested commit message footer:
Fixes #123
Refs #456
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always check for related issues** before committing
2. **Prefer `Fixes` over `Closes`** for bug fixes (clearer intent)
3. **Use `Refs` for partial work** to maintain traceability without premature closure
4. **Include multiple references** when a commit addresses several issues
5. **Verify issue state** - don't reference already-closed issues unless reopening
6. **Cross-reference PRs** - issues may already have linked PRs in progress

## Edge Cases

### No Matching Issues Found

If no open issues match the staged changes:
- Consider if an issue should be created first (for traceability)
- For trivial fixes, commit without issue reference is acceptable
- For significant changes, create issue retroactively and link in PR

### Multiple Matching Issues

When several issues relate to the same changes:
```bash
# Close all that are fully resolved
Fixes #123, fixes #124, fixes #125

# Or mix closing and reference keywords
Fixes #123
Refs #124, #125
```

### Cross-Repository Issues

```bash
# Reference issue in another repository
Fixes owner/other-repo#42

# Common for monorepo or multi-repo projects
```
