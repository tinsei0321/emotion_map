Upgrade the blueprint structure to the latest format version.

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use blueprint-init instead when... |
|---|---|
| The project has a manifest at v1.x, v2.x, v3.0, v3.1, or v3.2 | The project has no `docs/blueprint/manifest.json` at all |
| You want the user-facing upgrade entry point with prompts | Use blueprint-migration instead when implementing version-specific logic |
| You're adding the v3.2 task registry or v3.3 monorepo workspaces | Use blueprint-execute instead when you want auto-detection of next step |
| You're running batch upgrades across repos with `--non-interactive`/`-y` | Use blueprint-status instead to first audit current version |

**Current Format Version**: 3.3.0

This command delegates version-specific migration logic to the `blueprint-migration` skill.

## Parameters

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for flags before running any step:

- `--non-interactive`, `--yes`, `-y`: Skip every `AskUserQuestion` prompt and apply the defaults in the table below. Intended for batch runs across many repos (e.g. looping `/blueprint:upgrade -y` over FVH repos that are already on `main`).

Set an internal `$NONINTERACTIVE` flag to `true` when any of those tokens appear in `$ARGUMENTS`; otherwise `false`. Reference this flag at every `AskUserQuestion` call site in the steps below.

### Non-interactive defaults

When `$NONINTERACTIVE` is `true`, use these answers without prompting and record them in `upgrade_history[].changes` as "auto-selected in non-interactive mode":

| Decision point | Step | Default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remove deprecated generated commands | 3 | "Yes, remove" | Matches "Recommended" option; the files are known-obsolete |
| Task-registry scheduling mode | 3a | "Prompt before running" | Safest; preserves pre-existing behaviour for all tasks |
| Upgrade confirmation | 5 | "Yes, upgrade now" | The flag is explicit consent; skip the confirmation gate |
| Enable document detection (v1.x→v2.0) | 7f | "No, keep manual commands only" | Additive feature; do not silently change behaviour in batch mode |
| Migrate root documentation (v1.x→v2.0) | 7g | "No, leave in root" | Least destructive; moving root docs is reversible but surprising |
| Post-upgrade next action | 11 | Skip — report and exit | The caller is responsible for follow-up in a batch context |

For the `v2.x → v3.0` modification-preservation prompt (delegated to `migrations/v2.x-to-v3.0.md`), default to **"Keep modifications"** — never discard user-edited content in batch mode, and never "Cancel migration" silently.

If a migration step would require any prompt not listed above, **abort the upgrade** with a clear message rather than guessing. The caller can re-run interactively for those repos.

**Steps**:

1. **Check current state**:
   - Resolve manifest path — check all known locations (in order):
     1. `docs/blueprint/.manifest.json` (v3.0+ dot-prefixed)
     2. `docs/blueprint/manifest.json` (v3.1+ without dot prefix)
     3. `.claude/blueprints/.manifest.json` (v1.x/v2.x location)
   - Store the resolved path as `$MANIFEST`; if not found in any location, suggest running `/blueprint:init` instead
   - Extract current `format_version` (default to "1.0.0" if field missing)

2. **Determine upgrade path**:
   ```bash
   # Resolve manifest path once — use $MANIFEST in all subsequent jq commands
   if [[ -f docs/blueprint/.manifest.json ]]; then
     MANIFEST=docs/blueprint/.manifest.json
   elif [[ -f docs/blueprint/manifest.json ]]; then
     MANIFEST=docs/blueprint/manifest.json
   elif [[ -f .claude/blueprints/.manifest.json ]]; then
     MANIFEST=.claude/blueprints/.manifest.json
   else
     echo "ERROR: no blueprint manifest found. Run /blueprint:init first."
     exit 1
   fi
   current=$(jq -r '.format_version // "1.0.0"' "$MANIFEST")
   target="3.3.0"
   ```

   **Important**: Store the resolved `$MANIFEST` path. Use it in every `jq` invocation throughout this skill and in all delegated migration steps. This avoids silent failures when the filename differs from what a command hard-codes.

   **Version compatibility matrix**:
   | From Version | To Version | Migration Document |
   |--------------|------------|-------------------|
   | 1.0.x        | 1.1.x      | `migrations/v1.0-to-v1.1.md` |
   | 1.x.x        | 2.0.0      | `migrations/v1.x-to-v2.0.md` |
   | 2.x.x        | 3.0.0      | `migrations/v2.x-to-v3.0.md` |
   | 3.0.x        | 3.1.0      | `migrations/v3.0-to-v3.1.md` |
   | 3.1.x        | 3.2.0      | inline (step 3a) |
   | 3.2.x        | 3.3.0      | `migrations/v3.2-to-v3.3.md` |
   | 3.3.0        | 3.3.0      | Already up to date |

3. **Check for deprecated generated commands**:

   Check for skills generated by the now-deprecated `/blueprint:generate-commands`:

   ```bash
   # Check for generated project skills (both naming conventions)
   ls .claude/skills/project-continue/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
   ls .claude/skills/project-test-loop/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
   # Also check legacy command paths
   ls .claude/commands/project-continue.md 2>/dev/null
   ls .claude/commands/project/continue.md 2>/dev/null

   # Check manifest for generated entries
   jq -r '.generated.commands // {} | keys[]' "$MANIFEST" 2>/dev/null
   ```

   **If deprecated entries found**:
   - Report: "Found deprecated generated commands/skills from /blueprint:generate-commands"
   - List the files found
   - If `$NONINTERACTIVE` is `true`, skip the prompt and proceed as if "Yes, remove deprecated commands" was chosen.
   - Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion:
     ```
     question: "Found deprecated generated commands. These are no longer needed - /blueprint:execute handles workflow orchestration. Remove them?"
     options:
       - label: "Yes, remove deprecated commands (Recommended)"
         description: "Delete generated command files and clean up manifest"
       - label: "Keep for now"
         description: "Skip removal, continue with upgrade"
     ```
   - **If "Yes"**:
     - Delete the command files found
     - Remove entries from `manifest.generated.commands`
     - Add to upgrade_history: "Removed deprecated generated commands"
   - **If "Keep"**: Continue to step 4

   **If no deprecated commands**: Continue to step 4

---

3a. **v3.1 → v3.2 migration: Add task registry**:

   a. **Check if task_registry already exists**:
      ```bash
      jq -e '.task_registry' "$MANIFEST" 2>/dev/null
      ```

      If exists, skip to next step.

   b. **Ask about maintenance task scheduling**:

      If `$NONINTERACTIVE` is `true`, skip the prompt and use "Prompt before running" (no tasks become auto-run).

      Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion:
      ```
      question: "New feature: Task Registry tracks when maintenance tasks last ran. How should tasks be scheduled?"
      options:
        - label: "Prompt before running (Recommended)"
          description: "Always ask before running maintenance tasks"
        - label: "Auto-run safe tasks"
          description: "Read-only tasks run automatically when due"
        - label: "Manual only"
          description: "Tasks only run when explicitly invoked"
      ```

   c. **Add task_registry to manifest**:
      Use `jq` to add the `task_registry` section to `"$MANIFEST"` with all tasks defaulting to:
      - `enabled: true` (except `curate-docs` which defaults to `false`)
      - `auto_run`: based on user choice (safe read-only tasks: `adr-validate`, `feature-tracker-sync`, `sync-ids`)
      - `last_completed_at: null`
      - `last_result: null`
      - Default schedules: `derive-plans` → `weekly`, `derive-rules` → `weekly`, `generate-rules` → `on-change`, `adr-validate` → `weekly`, `feature-tracker-sync` → `daily`, `sync-ids` → `on-change`, `claude-md` → `on-change`, `curate-docs` → `on-demand`
      - `stats: {}`
      - `context: {}`

   d. **Bump format_version to 3.2.0**

---

3b. **v3.2 → v3.3 migration: Monorepo support**:

   Delegate to `skills/blueprint-migration/migrations/v3.2-to-v3.3.md`. Summary of what it does:

   a. Classify the blueprint as `root`, `child`, or `standalone` by walking ancestors and descendants for other blueprint manifest files.
   b. Add a `workspaces` block to `$MANIFEST` (omitted for standalone).
   c. Bump `format_version` to `3.3.0` and append an entry to `upgrade_history`.
   d. For root blueprints, run `/blueprint:workspace-scan` to populate `workspaces.children`.
   e. (Optional) Initialise the root `feature-tracker.json` `workspaces` summary for portfolio FR tracking.

   All changes are purely additive — standalone projects get no new top-level keys beyond `format_version` and `upgrade_history`.

4. **Display upgrade plan**:
   ```
   Blueprint Upgrade

   Current version: v{current}
   Target version: v3.3.0

   Major changes in v3.0:
   - Blueprint state moves from .claude/blueprints/ to docs/blueprint/
   - Generated skills become rules in .claude/rules/
   - No more generated/ subdirectory - cleaner structure
   - All blueprint-related files consolidated under docs/blueprint/

   Major changes in v3.2:
   - Task registry tracks operational metadata for maintenance tasks
   - Smart scheduling: tasks know when they were last run
   - Enable/disable individual tasks
   - Incremental operations with context persistence

   Major changes in v3.3:
   - First-class monorepo support: root/child/standalone roles
   - `workspaces` block in manifest.json (additive; standalone projects omit it)
   - New /blueprint:workspace-scan skill for discovering child blueprints
   - Cross-workspace references (`<path>/ADR-NNN`, `/ADR-NNN`)
   - Optional portfolio feature tracking via implemented_by links

   (For v2.0 changes when upgrading from v1.x:)
   - PRDs, ADRs, PRPs move to docs/ (project documentation)
   - Custom overrides in .claude/skills/
   - Content hashing for modification detection
   ```

5. **Confirm with user**:

   If `$NONINTERACTIVE` is `true`, skip this confirmation and proceed directly to step 6.

   Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   question: "Ready to upgrade blueprint from v{current} to v3.3.0?"
   options:
     - "Yes, upgrade now" → proceed
     - "Show detailed migration steps" → display migration document
     - "Create backup first" → run git stash or backup then proceed
     - "Cancel" → exit
   ```

6. **Load and execute migration document**:
   - Read the appropriate migration document from `blueprint-migration` skill
   - For v1.x → v2.0: Load `migrations/v1.x-to-v2.0.md`
   - For v2.x → v3.0: Load `migrations/v2.x-to-v3.0.md`
   - For v3.0 → v3.1: Load `migrations/v3.0-to-v3.1.md`
   - For v3.1 → v3.2: Execute inline step 3a above
   - For v3.2 → v3.3: Load `migrations/v3.2-to-v3.3.md` (see step 3b summary)
   - Execute each step with user confirmation for destructive operations

7. **v1.x → v2.0 migration overview** (from migration document):

   a. **Create docs/ structure**:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p docs/prds docs/adrs docs/prps
      ```

   b. **Move documentation to docs/**:
      - `.claude/blueprints/prds/*` → `docs/prds/`
      - `.claude/blueprints/adrs/*` → `docs/adrs/`
      - `.claude/blueprints/prps/*` → `docs/prps/`

   c. **Create generated/ structure**:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p .claude/blueprints/generated/skills
      mkdir -p .claude/blueprints/generated/commands
      ```

   d. **Relocate generated content**:
      - For each skill in `manifest.generated_artifacts.skills`:
        - Hash current content
        - If modified: offer to promote to `.claude/skills/` (custom layer)
        - Otherwise: move to `.claude/blueprints/generated/skills/`

   e. **Update manifest to v2.0.0 schema**:
      - Add `generated` section with content tracking
      - Add `custom_overrides` section
      - Add `project.detected_stack` field
      - Bump `format_version` to "2.0.0"

   f. **Enable document detection option** (new in v2.1):

      If `$NONINTERACTIVE` is `true`, skip the prompt and keep document detection disabled (treat as "No - Keep manual commands only").

      Otherwise:
      ```
      Use AskUserQuestion:
      question: "Would you like to enable automatic document detection? (New feature)"
      options:
        - label: "Yes - Detect PRD/ADR/PRP opportunities"
          description: "Claude will prompt when conversations should become documents"
        - label: "No - Keep manual commands only"
          description: "Continue using explicit /blueprint: commands"
      ```

      If enabled:
      - Set `has_document_detection: true` in manifest
      - If modular rules enabled, copy `document-management-rule.md` template to `.claude/rules/document-management.md`

   g. **Migrate root documentation** (if any found):
      ```bash
      # Find documentation files in root (excluding standard files)
      fd -d 1 -e md . | grep -viE '^\./(README|CHANGELOG|CONTRIBUTING|LICENSE|CODE_OF_CONDUCT|SECURITY)'
      ```

      If documentation files found (e.g., REQUIREMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN.md):

      If `$NONINTERACTIVE` is `true`, skip the prompt and leave root documentation in place (treat as "No, leave in root").

      Otherwise:
      ```
      Use AskUserQuestion:
      question: "Found documentation files in root: {file_list}. Would you like to migrate them to docs/?"
      options:
        - label: "Yes, migrate to docs/"
          description: "Move to appropriate docs/ subdirectory"
        - label: "No, leave in root"
          description: "Keep files in current location"
      ```

      If "Yes" selected:
      - Analyze each file to determine document type
      - Move to appropriate `docs/` subdirectory
      - Record migration in upgrade_history

8. **v2.x → v3.0 migration overview** (from migration document):

   a. **Create docs/blueprint/ structure**:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p docs/blueprint/work-orders
      mkdir -p docs/blueprint/ai_docs
      ```

   b. **Move state files from .claude/blueprints/ to docs/blueprint/**:
      ```bash
      # Move manifest
      mv .claude/blueprints/.manifest.json docs/blueprint/.manifest.json

      # Move work overview if exists
      [[ -f .claude/blueprints/work-overview.md ]] && \
        mv .claude/blueprints/work-overview.md docs/blueprint/work-overview.md

      # Move feature tracker if exists
      [[ -f .claude/blueprints/feature-tracker.md ]] && \
        mv .claude/blueprints/feature-tracker.md docs/blueprint/feature-tracker.md

      # Move work orders if exist
      [[ -d .claude/blueprints/work-orders ]] && \
        mv .claude/blueprints/work-orders/* docs/blueprint/work-orders/ 2>/dev/null

      # Move ai_docs if exist
      [[ -d .claude/blueprints/ai_docs ]] && \
        mv .claude/blueprints/ai_docs/* docs/blueprint/ai_docs/ 2>/dev/null
      ```

   c. **Move generated skills to .claude/rules/**:
      ```bash
      # Create rules directory if needed
      mkdir -p .claude/rules

      # Move each generated skill to rules
      for skill in .claude/blueprints/generated/skills/*.md; do
        [[ -f "$skill" ]] || continue
        name=$(basename "$skill" .md)
        mv "$skill" ".claude/rules/${name}.md"
      done
      ```

   d. **Copy README template to docs/blueprint/**:
      ```bash
      # Create docs/blueprint/README.md with overview of blueprint structure
      cat > docs/blueprint/README.md << 'EOF'
      # Blueprint Documentation

      This directory contains the blueprint state and documentation for this project.

      ## Contents

      - `.manifest.json` - Blueprint configuration and generated content tracking
      - `feature-tracker.json` - Feature tracking with tasks and progress
      - `work-orders/` - Detailed work order documents
      - `ai_docs/` - AI-generated documentation

      ## Related Directories

      - `docs/prds/` - Product Requirements Documents
      - `docs/adrs/` - Architecture Decision Records
      - `docs/prps/` - Problem Resolution Plans
      - `.claude/rules/` - Generated rules (from blueprint)
      EOF
      ```

   e. **Update manifest to v3.0.0 schema**:
      - Change `generated.skills` to `generated.rules`
      - Update all path references from `.claude/blueprints/` to `docs/blueprint/`
      - Bump `format_version` to "3.0.0"

   f. **Remove old .claude/blueprints/ directory**:
      ```bash
      # Verify all content has been moved
      if [[ -d .claude/blueprints ]]; then
        # Remove empty directories
        rm -rf .claude/blueprints/generated
        rm -rf .claude/blueprints/work-orders
        rm -rf .claude/blueprints/ai_docs
        # Remove the blueprints directory if empty
        rmdir .claude/blueprints 2>/dev/null || \
          echo "Warning: .claude/blueprints/ not empty, manual cleanup may be needed"
      fi
      ```

9. **Update manifest** (v3.0.0 schema): write the manifest using the v3.0.0 schema template in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md). Preserve `created_at`, `project.name`, `project.type`, `structure.has_modular_rules`, and `structure.claude_md_mode` from the previous manifest. Set `updated_at` to now, `created_by.blueprint_plugin` to "3.0.0", and `generated.rules` from the migrated skills→rules conversion.

10. **Report**: print the upgrade report using the standard template in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md), substituting `{previous}` with the prior `format_version` and `{n}` placeholders with the actual counts.

11. **Prompt for next action**:

   If `$NONINTERACTIVE` is `true`, skip this prompt entirely — print the report from step 10 and return. The batch caller owns follow-up (status checks, commits, etc.).

   Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   question: "Upgrade complete. What would you like to do next?"
   options:
     - label: "Check status (Recommended)"
       description: "Run /blueprint:status to see updated configuration"
     - label: "Regenerate rules from PRDs"
       description: "Update generated rules with new tracking"
     - label: "Update CLAUDE.md"
       description: "Reflect new architecture in project docs"
     - label: "Commit changes"
       description: "Stage and commit the migration"
   ```

   **Based on selection:**
   - "Check status" → Run `/blueprint:status`
   - "Regenerate rules" → Run `/blueprint:generate-rules`
   - "Update CLAUDE.md" → Run `/blueprint:claude-md`
   - "Commit changes" → Run `/git:commit` with migration message

**Post-migration assertion**:
After any version bump, verify `format_version` actually changed to the target. This catches silent failures where `jq` operated on the wrong path and exited 0 with empty output:

```bash
actual=$(jq -r '.format_version' "$MANIFEST")
if [[ "$actual" != "$target" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Migration failed — format_version is '$actual', expected '$target'"
  echo "Check that $MANIFEST was written correctly and rerun the migration step."
  exit 1
fi
echo "Migration verified: format_version = $actual in $MANIFEST"
```

**Rollback**:
If upgrade fails:
- Check git status for changes made
- Use `git checkout -- .claude/` and `git checkout -- docs/blueprint/` to restore original structure
- Manually move content back if needed
- Report specific failure point for debugging
