# /finops:overview

Display a quick FinOps summary including org-level billing (if admin) and current repository workflow/cache statistics.

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use a sibling instead when... |
|---|---|
| You need a first-look snapshot of CI costs, cache, and workflow health | You need a detailed cache breakdown — use `/finops:caches` |
| You want billing + cache + workflow stats in one view before drilling deeper | You need per-workflow run frequency and duration analysis — use `/finops:workflows` |
| You are deciding which finops skill to run next | You want to find and fix CI waste patterns — use `/finops:waste` |
| You want a single-repo summary | You want to benchmark across many repos in an org — use `/finops:compare` |

## Context

- Current repo URL: !`git remote get-url origin`

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `org` | GitHub organization name | Current repo's owner |

## Execution

```bash
bash "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/billing-summary.sh" $ARGS
```

## Output Format

```
=== Org Billing: orgname ===
Minutes: 1234/2000 included, 0 paid

=== Org Cache Usage ===
45 caches, 2340MB total

=== Repo: orgname/reponame ===
Cache:
  12 caches, 450MB

Workflows (last 30 days):
  CI: 45 runs (40 ok, 3 fail, 2 skip)
  Deploy: 12 runs (12 ok, 0 fail, 0 skip)
  CodeQL: 30 runs (28 ok, 0 fail, 2 skip)

=== Waste Indicators ===
Skipped runs: 4/87
Workflows missing concurrency: 2
```

## Agentic Optimizations

| Context | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Org billing (JSON) | `gh api "/orgs/{org}/settings/billing/actions" --jq '.'` |
| Repo cache summary | `gh api "/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/caches" --jq '{total: .total_count}'` |
| Workflow list | `gh workflow list --json name,state` |
| Recent runs (compact) | `gh run list --limit 20 --json status,conclusion,name` |
| Compact overview | `bash "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/billing-summary.sh" $ARGS` |

## Post-actions

Suggest next steps based on findings:
- High skipped runs -> `/finops:waste`
- High cache usage -> `/finops:caches`
- Want detailed workflow analysis -> `/finops:workflows`
- Compare across repos -> `/finops:compare`
