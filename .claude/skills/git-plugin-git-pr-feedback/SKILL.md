## Context

- Repo: !`git remote -v`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain=v2 --branch`

## Parameters

Parse these parameters from the command (all optional):

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `$1` | PR number (if omitted, use PR of current branch; if no such PR, list actionable PRs). Mutually exclusive with `--all`. |
| `--commit` | Create commit(s) after addressing feedback. |
| `--push` | Push changes after committing (implies `--commit`). |
| `--all` | Address feedback on every actionable open PR. Dispatches one subagent per PR in an isolated worktree; the orchestrator pushes, replies, and resolves. Implies `--commit --push` unless `--dry-run` is set. Mutually exclusive with `$1`. |
| `--dry-run` | With `--all`, print the dispatch plan and stop — no subagents spawned, no commits, no pushes. Ignored without `--all`. |
| `--limit N` | Maximum concurrent subagents under `--all` (default `3`). Use a small number to stay under GitHub rate limits and avoid `[1m]`-model concurrency cascades (see [`skill-fork-context.md`](../../../.claude/rules/skill-fork-context.md)). |
| `--include-automation` | With `--all`, also surface automation-authored PRs (release-please, dependabot, renovate, `*[bot]`, `*-bot`). Excluded by default because they carry no human review feedback and their CI failures are resolved by automation re-running, not hand edits. |

**Mode selection**:

| Mode | Triggered when | Flow |
|------|----------------|------|
| Single-PR | No `--all` | Steps 1–7 below operate on one PR. |
| Multi-PR | `--all` is passed | **Step 1A** dispatches subagents; the orchestrator finalises (push, reply, resolve, re-request) and writes a combined summary. Skip Steps 1–6. |

If both `$1` and `--all` are given, error and stop with: `--all is mutually exclusive with a PR number argument.`

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use another skill instead when... |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| A PR has reviewer comments to address | CI checks are failing with no review comments -> use `git-fix-pr` |
| You need to systematically work through review feedback | You're creating a new PR -> use `git-commit-push-pr` |
| A reviewer has requested changes | You want to understand PR workflow patterns -> use `git-branch-pr-workflow` |

## Your Task

Review PR workflow results and reviewer comments, then address substantive feedback.

For feedback categorization, decision trees, commit format, and report templates, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

### Step 1: Determine PR and Gather All Data

> If `--all` is set, **skip this step** and jump to **Step 1A: Multi-PR Mode** below.

1. **Parse owner/repo** from the git remote URL.

2. **Resolve the PR number** in this order:
   1. If `$1` was provided, use it.
   2. Otherwise, try the PR for the current branch:
      ```bash
      gh pr view --json number -q '.number'
      ```
   3. If step 2 fails (no PR for the branch) **or** the command is on a detached/default branch, fall back to listing actionable PRs:
      ```bash
      bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/list-actionable-prs.sh <owner> <repo>
      ```
      The script emits a JSON array of open, non-draft PRs that have unresolved review threads, failing/errored CI, or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Handle the result as follows:

      | Result | Action |
      |--------|--------|
      | Empty array | Report "No PRs need attention." and stop. |
      | One entry | Use that PR number and continue. |
      | Multiple entries | Print a compact table (number, author, CI, unresolved, reviewDecision, title) ordered as returned, then stop and instruct the user to re-run `/git:pr-feedback <number>`. Do **not** guess which PR they meant. |

3. **Switch to PR branch** if not already on it:
   ```bash
   gh pr view $PR --json headRefName -q '.headRefName'
   git switch <branch-name>
   git pull origin <branch-name>
   ```

4. **Fetch ALL PR data** using the bundled script (single GraphQL query):
   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch-pr-data.sh <owner> <repo> <pr-number>
   ```

5. **For failed checks only**, fetch detailed logs:
   ```bash
   gh run view $RUN_ID --log-failed
   ```

| Check Status | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| All passing | Skip to Step 2 |
| Failed CI | Get logs with `gh run view`, may need fixes |
| Pending | Note status, focus on comments |

If the GraphQL query fails with a rate limit error, wait 60 seconds and retry once.

---

### Step 1A: Multi-PR Mode (--all)

Reached only when `--all` is passed. The orchestrator dispatches one subagent per actionable PR; subagents commit inside isolated worktrees but never push. The orchestrator handles all GitHub-side mutations.

1. **Parse owner/repo** from the git remote URL.

2. **List actionable PRs** with the bundled selector (append `--include-automation` if that flag was passed):
   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/list-actionable-prs.sh <owner> <repo>
   ```
   The script returns a JSON array of open, non-draft PRs with unresolved review threads, failing/errored CI, or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Automation-authored PRs (release-please, dependabot, renovate, `*[bot]`, `*-bot`) are excluded by default — dispatching a subagent on one is almost always wrong (no review threads to act on, protected changelog/version files). Pass `--include-automation` to include them, or set `PR_FEEDBACK_AUTOMATION_AUTHORS` to extend the recognised author list. If the array is empty, report `No PRs need attention.` and stop.

3. **Print a compact dispatch table** (number, author, ci, unresolved, reviewDecision, head, title) so the user can see what is about to be processed.

4. **`--dry-run` short-circuit**: if `--dry-run` was also passed, additionally print the per-PR subagent prompt that *would* be dispatched (one per row, using the template in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) "Multi-PR Subagent Prompt"), then stop. No subagents spawn, no commits, no pushes.

5. **Dispatch subagents**, capped at `--limit N` concurrent (default `3`). For each PR call the `Task` tool with:
   - `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
   - `isolation: "worktree"` — each subagent gets its own git worktree
   - `description`: `Address review feedback for PR #<n>`
   - `prompt`: see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) "Multi-PR Subagent Prompt" for the canonical template. The prompt must instruct the subagent to switch its worktree to the PR's `headRefName`, run the single-PR feedback flow with `--commit` (not `--push`), and return a structured JSON summary.

   Dispatch one batch of `N` `Task` calls in a single message (per the parallel-dispatch contract). When all return, dispatch the next batch until the queue is empty.

6. **Collect subagent results**. Each subagent returns JSON with: `pr`, `branch`, `worktree_path`, `commits[]`, `addressed[]` (each with `thread_id`, `database_id`, `action`, `reply`, `resolve`), `deferred_issues[]`, `co_authors[]`, `blockers[]`. Treat any subagent that fails to return parseable JSON as blocked — record its raw output and continue with the rest of the batch.

7. **Orchestrator finalisation** — for each PR with successful commits, run sequentially (push and the GitHub mutation tools share the same rate-limit pool):
   1. `git push origin <branch>` from the **main checkout** — worktrees share the underlying `.git/`, so commits made by the subagent are already visible by branch name. No `cd` into the subagent's worktree is required.
   2. Capture the resolving SHA (`git rev-parse origin/<branch>` after the push).
   3. For each `addressed[]` entry, post the reply via `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment`, substituting the resolving SHA into any `{{SHA}}` placeholder the subagent left in the reply text.
   4. Resolve threads via the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation per Step 6's rules. Resolution is the default after a reply — only skip when the subagent set `resolve: false` for a documented exception (follow-up question, partial fix, reviewer asked to keep open, or a third-party PR without user approval). Treat any `resolve: true` paired with a successful reply as a mandatory call. Use:

      ```bash
      gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{isResolved}}}' -F id="$THREAD_ID"
      ```
   5. Re-request review per Step 5a's rules.

8. **Skip Steps 2–6**. Go directly to **Step 7** with a combined summary that includes a per-PR section plus a top-level rollup: dispatched, succeeded, blocked, total threads resolved, total commits pushed.

#### Failure handling

| Subagent state | Orchestrator action |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Returned valid JSON, has commits, no blockers | Push + reply + resolve as above |
| Returned valid JSON, no commits (only questions / declined nitpicks) | Skip push; still post replies and resolve declined nitpick threads |
| Returned valid JSON, has `blockers[]` | Surface in the summary; do **not** push partial work — let the user decide |
| Failed to return parseable JSON | Surface its raw output in the summary as `blocked: parse-error`; do nothing further for that PR |
| Reported a merge conflict on `git pull --ff-only` | Surface in the summary as `blocked: branch-out-of-sync`; user resolves manually |

A blocked subagent does not abort the whole batch; the orchestrator continues with the others.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Feedback

Categorize all comments from the GraphQL response (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for category definitions):

1. Skip any thread where `isResolved: true` or `isOutdated: true` — already handled.
2. Categorize each remaining comment as Blocking, Substantive, Suggestion, Question, or Nitpick.
3. For each actionable comment, capture: thread `id`, top-level comment `databaseId`, file, line, scope, and whether the body contains a ` ```suggestion ` block.
4. Create a todo list using TodoWrite with one item per actionable thread, including the thread `id` and `databaseId` so Steps 3–5 can reply and resolve.

---

### Step 3: Address Feedback

Work through actionable items systematically. For each thread, decide using the table below — see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the full decision tree.

| Comment shape | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Contains a ` ```suggestion ` block, fix is correct | **Accept the suggestion**: apply the suggestion's exact replacement to the file (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) "Accepting Suggestions"). Record the comment author's `login` and `name`/`email` for co-author attribution in Step 4. |
| Contains a ` ```suggestion ` block, fix needs adjustment | Implement an improved variant; explain the deviation in the reply. Record the suggester for co-author attribution. |
| Inline code comment without suggestion | Read context, implement fix, verify no regressions |
| Question / clarification | Skip code change; draft an inline reply for Step 4 |
| Blocking review (`REQUEST_CHANGES`) | Address every concern before resolving any thread |
| Failed CI check | Identify failure type (lint/type/test/build), fix locally, run to verify |
| Out-of-scope feedback | Do not implement in this PR. Open a follow-up issue (see Step 3a) and reference its number in the reply. |

Mark each todo `in_progress` while working it and `completed` once the file change (if any) lands locally. Do **not** resolve threads yet — replies and resolution happen after the commit so reviewers see the linked SHA.

### Step 3a: File follow-up issues for out-of-scope feedback

For any thread categorised as out-of-scope (or where the user opts to defer rather than implement now):

1. Draft a one-line title and short body that quotes the reviewer comment and links the PR thread URL.
2. Use `mcp__github__issue_write` (action `create`) or `gh issue create -R <owner>/<repo> --title "<title>" --body "<body>"` to file the issue.
3. Capture the returned issue number — Step 6's reply uses it (`Deferred to #<n> — <reason>.`).

Skip this step if the user has explicitly said not to file follow-ups. When ambiguous, ask via `AskUserQuestion` before creating an issue.

---

### Step 4: Commit Changes (if --commit or --push)

Group related fixes into logical commits — one commit per logical group of accepted suggestions, not one per suggestion. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for commit message format.

For any commit that contains an **accepted (or adapted) suggestion**, append a `Co-authored-by:` trailer for each unique suggester. This mirrors GitHub's "Commit suggestion" / "Add suggestion to batch" behaviour, which credits the suggester as co-author. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) "Co-author Attribution" for how to construct the trailer line and resolve the suggester's email.

Run pre-commit hooks if configured, then stage any formatter changes.

### Step 5: Push Changes (if --push)

```bash
git push origin HEAD
```

### Step 5a: Re-request Review (if --push)

After a successful push that addresses substantive feedback, re-request review from any reviewer whose threads were resolved or who left a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review. Skip this step when only nitpicks or questions were addressed.

Determine reviewers to re-request from the GraphQL response captured in Step 1:

- `latestReviews` entries with `state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED"`
- Authors of any review thread you resolved in Step 6

Then call:

```bash
gh api -X POST \
  /repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/requested_reviewers \
  -f 'reviewers[]=<login1>' \
  -f 'reviewers[]=<login2>'
```

If `gh api` returns 422 ("Reviews may only be requested from collaborators"), the reviewer cannot be re-requested via the API — note it in the Step 7 summary and continue.

### Step 6: Reply and Resolve Threads

For every actionable thread tracked in Step 2, post a reply and then **resolve the thread by default**. Owner/repo/PR are the same values used in Step 1.

Resolving is the default action after replying — leaving threads open is the exception, reserved for the explicit cases listed in step 3. A reply alone does **not** end the conversation in GitHub's UI: the thread stays in the reviewer's "unresolved" queue until someone clicks **Resolve conversation**. Without this step the PR will continue to show unresolved feedback even after every concern has been addressed.

1. **Reply** with `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment` using the top-level comment's `databaseId` (a number, not the GraphQL node ID). Keep replies short — see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) "Reply Templates".
   - Code change made → reference the commit SHA: `Fixed in <sha> by <one-line summary>.`
   - Suggestion accepted verbatim → `Accepted suggestion in <sha>.`
   - Suggestion adapted → explain the deviation: `Applied a variant in <sha>: <reason>.`
   - Deferred / out of scope → reference the follow-up issue filed in Step 3a: `Deferred to #<issue> — <reason>.`
   - Question → answer it directly.
   - Refuting a suggestion → state the reasoning: `Leaving as-is: <reason>.`

2. **Always resolve** with the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation using the thread `id` (a `PRRT_…` GraphQL node ID). Resolution is the default after a reply — only skip when one of step 3's "leave open" exceptions applies. Call:

   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{isResolved}}}' -F id="$THREAD_ID"
   ```

   Resolve when **any** of these completion conditions hold and none of step 3's "leave open" exceptions apply:
   - You pushed a commit that addresses the concern (`Fixed in <sha>`, `Accepted in <sha>`, `Applied a variant in <sha>`).
   - You answered the reviewer's question directly.
   - You refuted or declined the suggestion with explicit reasoning in the reply (a written refutation — not silence — completes the thread).
   - You deferred to a follow-up issue filed in Step 3a (the deferral and issue link are the resolution).

   Resolving must happen in the **same turn** as the reply. Treat "reply posted but thread unresolved" as an incomplete step — re-run the resolve call before reporting Step 7.

3. **Leave the thread open** only when one of these holds:
   - Your reply asks the reviewer a follow-up question (you are waiting on them).
   - The fix is partial — some of the concern still applies to this PR.
   - The reviewer explicitly asked to keep the thread open.
   - You haven't pushed yet (no resolving SHA exists) — finish Step 5, then resolve.
   - You're acting on a PR you don't own and the user has not approved resolving on third-party PRs.

If `--commit`/`--push` was not passed, still post replies for questions and refutations, but defer resolution until a future invocation with `--push` lands the SHA. Note these pending resolutions in the Step 7 summary so they're not forgotten.

### Step 7: Summary Report

Provide a summary table of feedback addressed, replies posted, threads resolved, and next steps. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the report template.
