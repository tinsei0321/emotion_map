## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use X instead when... |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Going from uncommitted changes to an open PR in one step | Creating commits only with no push or PR (`/git:commit`) |
| Auto-detecting issues, committing, pushing, and opening a PR together | Pushing existing commits to a remote without opening a PR (`/git:push`) |
| Running the full commit-push-PR pipeline non-interactively | Opening a PR from already-pushed commits (`/git:pr-create`) |

## Context

- Pre-commit config: !`find . -maxdepth 1 -name ".pre-commit-config.yaml"`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain=v2 --branch`
- Unstaged changes: !`git diff --numstat`
- Staged changes: !`git diff --cached --numstat`
- Recent commits: !`git log --format='%h %s' --max-count=10`
- Git remotes: !`git remote -v`

Available labels and open issues are fetched during execution (requires a configured git remote).

## Parameters

Parse these parameters from the command (all optional):

- `$1`: Remote branch name to push to (e.g., `feat/auth-oauth2`). If not provided, auto-generate from first commit type. Ignored with `--direct`.
- `--push`: Automatically push after commits
- `--direct`: Push current branch directly to same-named remote (e.g., `git push origin main`). Mutually exclusive with `--pr`.
- `--pr` / `--pull-request`: Create pull request after pushing (implies --push, uses feature branch pattern)
- `--draft`: Create as draft PR (requires --pr)
- `--issue <num>`: Link to specific issue number (requires --pr)
- `--no-commit`: Skip commit creation (assume commits already exist)
- `--range <start>..<end>`: Push specific commit range instead of all commits
- `--labels <label1,label2>`: Apply labels to the created PR (requires --pr)
- `--skip-issue-detection`: Skip automatic issue detection (use when --issue is provided or for trivial changes)

## Your task

**IMPORTANT: Execute all steps continuously without pausing to ask for confirmation between steps.** This is a complete workflow — commit, push, and PR creation flow as a single operation. Do not stop after committing to ask whether to push or create a PR; proceed through all applicable steps.

### Step 1: Verify State and Prepare Branch

1. **Check for changes**: Confirm there are staged or unstaged changes to commit (unless --no-commit)
2. **Prepare branch**:
   - If `--direct`: any branch is valid, stay on current branch
   - If on main/master: create a local feature branch before committing. Auto-generate the name from the changes (e.g., `fix/handle-timeout-edge-case`, `feat/add-oauth-support`). Use `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
   - If already on a feature branch: stay on it

### Step 2: Auto-Detect Related Issues (unless --skip-issue-detection or --issue provided)

**Purpose**: Automatically identify open GitHub issues that the staged changes may fix or close.

1. **Analyze staged changes**:
   - Get list of changed files: `git diff --cached --name-only`
   - Extract modified directories, file names, and content patterns
   - Identify error messages, function names, or keywords in the diff

2. **Match against open issues**:
   - Review the open issues from context (or fetch with `gh issue list --state open`)
   - Score each issue based on:
     - **High confidence**: File path mentioned in issue body, error message match
     - **Medium confidence**: Directory/component match, keyword overlap
     - **Low confidence**: Label matches changed area (e.g., `bug` label + fix changes)

3. **Report detected issues**:
   ```
   Detected potentially related issues:

   HIGH CONFIDENCE:
   - #123 "Login fails with invalid token" → Fixes #123
     Match: Changes to src/auth/token.ts, issue mentions token validation

   MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:
   - #456 "Improve error messages" → Refs #456
     Match: Error handling changes in src/auth/

   Suggested closing keywords for commit message:
   Fixes #123
   Refs #456
   ```

4. **Determine appropriate keywords**:
   - Use `Fixes #N` for bug fixes that fully resolve the issue
   - Use `Closes #N` for features that complete the issue
   - Use `Refs #N` for partial progress or related changes
   - See **github-issue-autodetect** skill for decision tree

5. **Confirm with user** (if uncertain):
   - For high-confidence matches, include automatically
   - For medium-confidence, suggest and confirm
   - For low-confidence, mention but let user decide

### Step 3: Create Commits (unless --no-commit)

1. **Analyze changes** and detect if splitting into multiple PRs is appropriate
2. **Group related changes** into logical commits
3. **Stage changes**: Use `git add -u` for modified files, `git add <file>` for new files
4. **Run pre-commit hooks** if configured: `pre-commit run`
5. **Handle pre-commit modifications**: Stage any files modified by hooks with `git add -u`
6. **Create commit** with conventional commit message format
7. **Include detected issue references** from Step 2 in the commit message footer:
   - Add high-confidence matches automatically
   - Include medium-confidence matches if confirmed
8. **ALWAYS include GitHub issue references** in commit messages:
   - **Closing keywords** (auto-close when merged to default branch):
     - `Fixes #N` - for bug fixes that resolve an issue
     - `Closes #N` - for features that complete an issue
     - `Resolves #N` - alternative closing keyword
   - **Reference without closing** (for related context):
     - `Refs #N` - references issue without closing
     - `Related to #N` - indicates relationship
   - **Cross-repository references**:
     - `Fixes owner/repo#N` - closes issue in different repo
   - **Multiple issues**: `Fixes #1, fixes #2, fixes #3`
   - Keywords are case-insensitive and work with optional colon: `Fixes: #123`

### Step 4: Push to Remote (if --push or --pr)

**If `--direct`**: Push current branch to same-named remote:

```bash
# Direct push to current branch
git push origin HEAD
```

**Otherwise** (feature branch — created in Step 1 or pre-existing):

```bash
# Push the current feature branch and set upstream
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### Step 5: Create PR (if --pr)

**5a. Identify post-merge follow-up actions.**

Before creating the PR, scan commit messages, diff context, and any conversation context for actions that must happen **after** the PR is merged:

| Signal | Examples |
|--------|---------|
| Commit messages | "migration", "run after deploy", "manual step", "update config" |
| File patterns | `*.sql`, migration files, deployment scripts, runbooks |
| Context | User mentioned a deployment step, documentation update, or announcement |

For each post-merge action identified, create a GitHub issue — **not a PR checklist item**. PR descriptions are closed and buried once a PR merges; issues remain open until resolved.

Write the follow-up body to a tempfile with the `Write` tool and pass it via `--body-file`. Inline `--body "..."` mangles backticks and multi-line content via shell escaping; see the **Body content** rule in `github-issue-writing`.

```bash
# Write tool → /tmp/follow-up.md (markdown body, no shell escaping)
gh issue create \
  --title "[Chore] DB: Run migration for new schema" \
  --body-file /tmp/follow-up.md \
  --label "chore"
# Note the returned issue number for the PR body
```

Common follow-up types: database migrations, production deployments, manual config changes, external documentation updates, customer-facing announcements, dependent follow-on PRs.

**5b. Create the PR**, including follow-up issue links in the body.

Use `mcp__github__create_pull_request` with:
- `head`: The remote branch name (e.g., `feat/auth-oauth2`)
- `base`: `main`
- `title`: Derived from commit message
- `body`: Include summary, issue link if --issue provided, and a **Follow-up Issues** section listing any issues created in 5a. The MCP tool takes the body as a JSON string parameter — no shell escaping, so backticks and code fences pass through unchanged.
- `draft`: true if --draft flag set

If falling back to `gh pr create` instead of the MCP tool, write the body to a tempfile and pass `--body-file /tmp/pr-body.md` (see the **Body content** rule in `github-issue-writing`).

PR body structure when follow-up issues exist:

```markdown
## Summary
...

## Follow-up Issues
<!-- Post-merge actions tracked as issues so they survive PR closure -->
- #456: run database migration for new schema
- #457: update production feature-flag config

## Related Issues
Fixes #123
```

If `--labels` provided, add labels after PR creation:
```bash
gh pr edit <pr-number> --add-label "label1,label2"
```

### Step 6: Watch PR Checks (if --pr)

After PR creation, watch CI checks to confirm the PR is ready for merge:

```bash
# Watch all checks (not just required — many repos have no required checks configured)
gh pr checks <pr-number> --watch --fail-fast
```

**On success (exit 0)**:
- Report: "All checks passed. PR #N is ready for merge."
- Provide merge command: `gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch`

> **Pitfall — `--delete-branch` from the PR's own working tree:** before running `gh pr merge <N> --squash --auto --delete-branch`, switch your working tree to `main` (or any branch other than the PR head). If your cwd or any worktree has the PR's branch checked out, the local-branch-delete step fails with `cannot delete branch 'X' used by worktree at Y` even though the server-side merge is queued correctly. The misleading error makes it look like the merge failed; confirm with `gh pr view <N> --json state`.
>
> Safer two-step pattern:
>
> ```bash
> git switch main
> git pull
> gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --auto --delete-branch
> ```

**On failure (exit 1)**:
- Report which check(s) failed with details:
  ```bash
  gh pr checks <pr-number> --json name,state,bucket,link --jq '.[] | select(.bucket == "fail")'
  ```
- Suggest: review failed check logs, fix issues, push again

## Workflow Guidance

- After running pre-commit hooks, stage files modified by hooks using `git add -u`
- Unstaged changes after pre-commit are expected formatter output - stage them and continue
- **Direct mode** (`--direct`): Use `git push origin HEAD` to push current branch directly
- **Feature branch mode** (default): Create a local feature branch from main, commit there, push with `git push -u origin <branch>`
- When encountering unexpected state, report findings and ask user how to proceed
- Include all pre-commit automatic fixes in commits
- **GitHub issue references (REQUIRED)**: Every commit should reference related issues:
  - **Closing keywords** (`Fixes`, `Closes`, `Resolves`) auto-close issues when merged to default branch
  - **Reference keywords** (`Refs`, `Related to`, `See`) link without closing - use for partial work
  - Format examples: `Fixes #123`, `Fixes: #123`, `fixes org/repo#123`
  - Multiple issues: `Fixes #1, fixes #2, fixes #3` (repeat keyword for each)
  - When `--issue <num>` provided, use `Fixes #<num>` or `Closes #<num>` in commit body
  - If no specific issue exists, consider creating one first for traceability
