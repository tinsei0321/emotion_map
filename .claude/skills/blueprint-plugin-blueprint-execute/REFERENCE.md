## Examples

### Example 1: Uninitialized Project

```bash
$ /blueprint:execute
```

Output:
```
Blueprint not initialized in this project.

Initializing blueprint structure...
[Runs /blueprint:init]
```

### Example 2: Has Ready PRPs

```bash
$ /blueprint:execute
```

Output:
```
Blueprint Status: Up to date (v3.0.0)

Found 2 ready PRPs:
1. add-authentication.md (confidence: 9/10)
2. optimize-performance.md (confidence: 8/10)

[Prompts: Which PRP to execute?]
```

### Example 3: All Caught Up

```bash
$ /blueprint:execute
```

Output:
```
Blueprint Status: Up to date (v3.0.0)

No pending PRPs, work-orders, or stale content detected.

[Shows full status from /blueprint:status]
[Prompts: What would you like to do next?]
```

### Example 4: Stale Generated Content

```bash
$ /blueprint:execute
```

Output:
```
Blueprint Status: Attention needed

Stale generated content detected: 2 files
- architecture-patterns.md (PRD changed on 2026-01-13)
- testing-strategies.md (PRD changed on 2026-01-12)

[Prompts: Regenerate from PRDs?]
```

## Common Workflows

### Morning Start Routine
```bash
$ /blueprint:execute  # Figures out where you left off
```

### After Pulling Changes
```bash
$ /blueprint:execute  # Checks for stale content, upgrades, etc.
```

### Periodic Check-in
```bash
$ /blueprint:execute  # Shows progress, suggests next work
```

### Stuck or Unsure
```bash
$ /blueprint:execute  # Always knows what to do next
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced cognitive load**: No need to remember which command to run
2. **Progressive workflow**: Naturally guides through blueprint methodology
3. **Safe exploration**: Can run anytime without breaking things
4. **Smart defaults**: Automatically picks the right action for current state
5. **Flexible**: Can skip actions and continue to next check
6. **Always actionable**: Always suggests next steps, never leaves you stuck

## Feature Tracker Auto-Sync Details

When feature tracker exists and is stale (> 1 day old), or a PRP was just executed, or a work-order was completed:

1. Read current feature-tracker.json
2. Read TODO.md (if exists) for checkbox states
3. Detect any discrepancies (checked boxes vs tracker status)
4. Auto-resolve discrepancies by trusting TODO.md (most recently edited by user)
5. Update feature-tracker.json with new statistics and task states
6. Report changes made (if any)

Auto-sync is silent when no changes - only reports if something was updated.

## Task Registry Schedule Logic

### Due Calculation

| Schedule | Due When |
|----------|----------|
| `daily` | `last_completed_at` is null OR > 24 hours ago |
| `weekly` | `last_completed_at` is null OR > 7 days ago |
| `on-change` | Source inputs changed since last run (task-specific) |
| `on-demand` | Never auto-suggested; only runs on explicit invocation |

### Priority Order for Due Tasks

When multiple tasks are due, execute in this order:
1. `sync-ids` (fast, foundational)
2. `feature-tracker-sync` (fast, updates status)
3. `adr-validate` (fast, read-only check)
4. `generate-rules` (may modify files)
5. `derive-rules` (may modify files)
6. `derive-plans` (longer running)
7. `claude-md` (depends on other outputs)

### Auto-Run Task Prompt (for due non-auto tasks)

```
question: "These maintenance tasks are due. Which would you like to run?"
options:
  - label: "Run all due tasks"
    description: "Execute {N} due tasks in priority order"
  - label: "Choose specific tasks"
    description: "Select which tasks to run"
  - label: "Skip maintenance"
    description: "Continue to other actions"
```
