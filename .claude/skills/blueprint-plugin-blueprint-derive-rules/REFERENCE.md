Reference material for git analysis patterns, rule templates, and conflict resolution procedures.

## Git Analysis Patterns

### Decision Indicators

| Pattern | Rule Category | Examples |
|---------|---|---|
| `refactor:` + consistent pattern | Code style | File organization, naming conventions, imports |
| `fix:` repeated for same issue | Prevention | Common bugs, security issues, performance problems |
| `feat!:` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Architecture | API changes, dependency migrations, pattern switches |
| `chore:` + tooling changes | Tooling | Linter configs, formatter settings, CI changes |
| `style:` + formatting | Formatting | Indentation, spacing, code formatting |
| `test:` + testing approach | Testing | Test patterns, coverage, fixtures |
| `docs:` + documentation | Documentation | Documentation patterns, comment style |

### Extraction Commands

**Extract decision-bearing commits:**
```bash
git log --format="%H|%s|%b" {scope} | grep -E "(always|never|must|should|prefer|avoid|instead of|replaced|switched|adopted|dropped)"
```

**Group by domain:**
```bash
git log --oneline --format="%s" {scope} | sed 's/^[a-z]*(\([^)]*\)).*/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

**Detect conflicts (same topic):**
```bash
git log --format="%H|%ai|%s" | grep -i "{topic}" | sort -t'|' -k2 -r
```

## Rule Template

Every generated rule **MUST** include `paths:` frontmatter unless it genuinely applies to every file in the project. Rules without `paths:` load on every session — costing context budget for sessions that never touch the relevant files. Default to scoping; opt out only when the rule is truly universal (and document the choice in the rule body).

**Path-scoped rule** (the default — always start here):
```markdown
---
paths:
  - "{glob-pattern}"
  - "{glob-pattern}"
---

# {Rule Title}

{Rule description — applies only to matched paths}

## Source

- **Commit**: {sha} ({date})
- **Type**: {feat|fix|refactor|chore}
- **Confidence**: {High|Medium|Low}

## Rule

{Clear, actionable rule statement}

## Examples

### Do
\`\`\`{language}
{Good example from commit diff or codebase}
\`\`\`

### Don't
\`\`\`{language}
{Counter-example if available}
\`\`\`

## Supersedes

{List any earlier decisions this overrides, or "None"}

---

*Derived from git history via /blueprint:derive-rules*
```

**Global rule** (no `paths:` — use only when the rule legitimately applies everywhere; document why):
```markdown
# {Rule Title}

*Global rule — applies to every file. Rationale: {one-line justification, e.g. "security mindset every contributor must follow regardless of language"}.*

## Source
...
```

## Rule Categories

Generate separate rule files by category. Every category has a default `paths:` derived from the detected stack — never omit `paths:` just because a category "feels global":

| File | Content | Source Commits | Default `paths:` |
|------|---------|---|---|
| `code-style.md` | Naming, formatting, structure rules | `refactor:`, `style:` | Detected language Globs (`["**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"]`, `["**/*.py"]`, `["**/*.rs"]`, etc.) |
| `testing-standards.md` | Testing approach, coverage, fixtures | `test:` | `["**/*.{test,spec}.*", "tests/**/*", "test/**/*"]` |
| `api-conventions.md` | Endpoint patterns, error handling | `feat:` (api scope), `fix:` (api scope) | `["src/{api,routes}/**/*", "**/*controller*", "**/*handler*"]` |
| `error-handling.md` | Exception patterns, fallbacks | `fix:` (error-related) | Detected language Globs (matches the languages the rule body cites) |
| `dependencies.md` | Package management, version policies | `chore:` (deps), `build:` | `["package.json", "go.mod", "Cargo.toml", "pyproject.toml", "*.lock", "biome.json", ".python-version"]` |
| `security-practices.md` | Auth, validation, secrets handling | `fix:` (security), `feat:` (security) | Auth/handler Globs (`["**/auth/**", "**/security/**", "**/*token*", "**/*credential*"]`) or detected-language Globs when the rule is language-specific |
| `development.md` (or similar) | Restatement of project context already in CLAUDE.md | _any_ | **Do not emit.** CLAUDE.md owns project context. |

**Detecting "language Globs"**: Inspect the rule's code blocks (\`\`\`js, \`\`\`ts, \`\`\`py, etc.) and the file paths cited in the rule body. The set of language fences and the directory roots in those paths is the rule's natural scope. Use brace expansion for concise patterns: `*.{ts,tsx}`, `src/{api,routes}/**/*`.

**When to omit `paths:` entirely**: Only when the rule explicitly says "applies to every file regardless of language" — universal philosophy statements about, e.g., security mindset that genuinely transcends language. Document the omission in the rule body with a one-line rationale.

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

### Detection
Find commits addressing same topic:
```bash
git log --format="%H|%ai|%s" | grep -i "{topic}" | sort -t'|' -k2 -r
```

### Resolution Rules
1. **Newer overrides older**: Latest decision wins
2. **Higher frequency wins**: If 5 commits say X and 1 says Y, X wins
3. **Breaking changes override**: `feat!:` trumps regular commits

### Handling Existing Rules
When conflict with existing rules under the configured `structure.generated_rules_path` (default `.claude/rules/`). Hand-written files outside that directory are never inspected:

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Git-derived overrides | Update existing rule with git-derived content |
| Keep existing | Use existing rule, document git decision as alternative |
| Merge both | Combine into comprehensive rule with both perspectives |
| Create separate | Add git-derived as additional rule |

### Superseding Pattern
Document overridden decisions:
```markdown
## Supersedes

- **Previous rule**: `code-style.md` - Naming convention v1 (commit abc1234)
- **Reason**: Updated to match newer pattern in commit def5678 (more common, 7 commits)
```

## Confidence Scoring

Rate confidence based on:

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **High** | Pattern appears 5+ times, explicit commit message, breaking change |
| **Medium** | Pattern appears 2-4 times, clear intent but not explicit |
| **Low** | Pattern appears 1 time, inferred from code change only |

## Manifest Format

```json
{
  "derived_rules": {
    "last_derived_at": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
    "commits_analyzed": N,
    "conventional_commits_percentage": 85,
    "rules_generated": N,
    "rules_by_category": {
      "code-style": N,
      "testing-standards": N,
      "api-conventions": N,
      "error-handling": N,
      "dependencies": N,
      "security-practices": N
    },
    "source_commits": [
      {
        "sha": "{sha}",
        "date": "ISO-8601",
        "type": "refactor|fix|feat|chore",
        "message": "commit message",
        "rule_generated": "code-style.md"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Tips

- **High commit quality**: More conventional commits = more reliable rules
- **Frequency matters**: Patterns that appear multiple times are more trustworthy
- **Recency wins**: Newer decisions override older ones
- **Breaking changes signal**: `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` indicates important architectural decision
- **User confirmation**: Always ask about significant decisions before making them rules
