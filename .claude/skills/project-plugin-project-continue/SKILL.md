## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use project-discovery instead when... |
|---|---|
| Resuming work on a known project with PRDs and feature-tracker state | Entering an unfamiliar codebase needing orientation on tooling/structure |
| Picking the next task off the feature tracker after a break | Use project-test-loop instead when the next step is iterating on failing tests |
| Asking "what's next" in a project with established blueprint state | Use project-init instead when no project structure exists yet |
| Resuming a TDD session and beginning implementation yourself | Use `/blueprint:execute` instead when you want blueprint to pick and run the next logical blueprint action (derive/sync/work-order) rather than continue coding |

Continue project development by analyzing current state and resuming work.

**Note**: Configure project-specific test/build commands in `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/rules/` for automatic detection.

**Steps**:

1. **Check current state**:
   ```bash
   # Check git status
   git status

   # Check recent commits
   git log -5 --oneline

   # Check current branch
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **Read project context**:
   - **PRDs**: Read all files in `docs/prds/`
     * Understand project goals and requirements
     * Identify features and phases
   - **Feature Tracker**: Read `docs/blueprint/feature-tracker.json` tasks section
     * Current phase and progress
     * Completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
   - **Work Orders**: Check `docs/blueprint/work-orders/`
     * Recent work-orders (see what's been done)
     * Pending work-orders (see what's planned)

3. **Analyze state and determine next task**:

   **If uncommitted changes exist**:
   - Review uncommitted files
   - Determine if work-in-progress should be continued
   - Ask user if they want to continue current work or start fresh

   **If on clean state**:
   - Compare feature tracker tasks against PRD requirements
   - Identify next logical task:
     * Next pending task in feature-tracker.json
     * Next requirement in PRD
     * Next work-order to execute
   - Consider dependencies (start with unblocked tasks first)

4. **Report status before starting**:
   ```
   📊 Project Status:

   Current Branch: [branch]
   Uncommitted Changes: [yes/no - list files if yes]

   Recent Work:
   - [Last 3 commits]

   PRDs Found:
   - [List PRD files with brief summary]

   Work Overview: Phase [N] - [Phase name]
   ✅ Completed: [N] tasks
   ⏳ In Progress: [Current task if any]
   ⏹️ Pending: [N] tasks

   Next Task: [Identified next task]
   Approach: [Brief plan]
   ```

5. **Begin work following TDD**:
   - Activate project-specific skills automatically:
     * Architecture patterns
     * Testing strategies
     * Implementation guides
     * Quality standards
   - Follow **RED → GREEN → REFACTOR** workflow:
     * Write failing test first
     * Minimal implementation to pass
     * Refactor while keeping tests green
   - Commit incrementally:
     * Use conventional commits
     * Commit after each RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle
     * Reference PRD or issue in commit message

6. **Update feature tracker as you go**:
   - Mark tasks in-progress
   - Mark tasks completed
   - Update next steps

**Important**:
- **Always start with tests** (TDD requirement)
- **Apply project skills** (architecture, testing, implementation, quality)
- **Commit incrementally** (after each successful cycle)
- **Update feature tracker** (keep project state current)

**Handling Common Scenarios**:

**Scenario: Starting new feature**:
1. Create work-order first with `/blueprint:work-order`
2. Then continue with this command

**Scenario: Blocked by dependency**:
1. Report the blocker
2. Suggest working on a different task
3. Or: Suggest implementing the dependency first

**Scenario: Tests failing**:
1. Analyze failures
2. Fix failing tests (always complete RED step first)
3. Continue once tests pass

**Scenario: Unclear what to do next**:
1. Review PRDs for requirements
2. Ask user for clarification
3. Suggest creating work-orders for clarity

## Agent Teams (Optional)

For large codebases with multiple work fronts, spawn teammates for parallel progress:

| Teammate | Focus | Value |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Research teammate | Investigate codebase state, PRDs, work-orders | Parallel context gathering |
| Implementation teammate | Begin work on next task from feature tracker | Start implementation immediately |

The research teammate gathers project state while the implementation teammate begins the most obvious next task. This is optional — single-session continuation works for most projects.
