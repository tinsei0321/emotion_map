Generate project-specific rules from Product Requirements Documents.

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use alternative when... |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Need to generate rules from existing PRDs | Use `/blueprint:rules` to manually create/edit rules |
| Want path-scoped rules for specific file types | Use `/blueprint:claude-md` for general project instructions |
| Automating rule creation from requirements | Writing custom rules without PRD reference |
| Extracting architecture/testing patterns from PRDs | Need to create one-off rules for specific contexts |

Rules are generated to the directory configured in `structure.generated_rules_path` (defaults to `.claude/rules/` when the field is absent). Rules with `paths` frontmatter are loaded conditionally when working on matching files.

## Steps

**Prerequisites**:
- `docs/prds/` directory exists
- At least one PRD file in `docs/prds/`

0. **Resolve the output path**:

   Read `structure.generated_rules_path` from `docs/blueprint/manifest.json` (default `.claude/rules/`):

   ```bash
   RULES_DIR=$(jq -r '.structure.generated_rules_path // ".claude/rules/"' docs/blueprint/manifest.json)
   mkdir -p "$RULES_DIR"
   ```

   Use `$RULES_DIR` for all subsequent reads/writes. This isolates blueprint-managed rules from any hand-written files in the parent `.claude/rules/` directory (issue #1043).

1. **Find and read all PRDs**:
   - Use Glob to find all `.md` files in `docs/prds/`
   - Read each PRD file
   - If no PRDs found, report error and suggest writing PRDs first

2. **Check for existing generated rules**:
   ```bash
   ls "$RULES_DIR" 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - Scope conflict checks to files under `$RULES_DIR` only — never to the parent `.claude/rules/`. Hand-written files outside `$RULES_DIR` are invisible to this check.
   - If rules exist, check manifest for content hashes
   - Compare current content hash vs stored hash
   - If modified, offer options: overwrite, skip, or backup

3. **Analyze PRDs and extract** (aggregated from all PRDs):

   **Architecture Patterns**:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Architectural style (MVC, layered, hexagonal, etc.)
   - Design patterns
   - Dependency injection approach
   - Error handling strategy
   - Code organization conventions
   - Integration patterns

   **Testing Strategies**:
   - TDD workflow requirements
   - Test types (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Mocking patterns
   - Coverage requirements
   - Test structure and organization
   - Test commands

   **Implementation Guides**:
   - How to implement APIs/endpoints
   - How to implement UI components (if applicable)
   - Database operation patterns
   - External service integration patterns
   - Background job patterns (if applicable)

   **Quality Standards**:
   - Code review checklist
   - Performance baselines
   - Security requirements (OWASP, validation, auth)
   - Code style and formatting
   - Documentation requirements
   - Dependency management

4. **Generate four aggregated domain rules**:

   Create in `$RULES_DIR` (the configured `structure.generated_rules_path`):

   **`architecture-patterns.md`**:
   - Aggregated patterns from all PRDs
   - Fill in project-specific patterns extracted from PRDs
   - Include code examples where possible
   - Reference specific files/directories

   **`testing-strategies.md`**:
   - Aggregated testing requirements from all PRDs
   - Fill in TDD requirements from PRDs
   - Include coverage requirements
   - Include test commands for the project
   - Add `paths` frontmatter if tests live in specific directories:
     ```yaml
     ---
     paths:
       - "tests/**/*"
       - "**/*.{test,spec}.*"
     ---
     ```

   **`implementation-guides.md`**:
   - Aggregated implementation patterns from all PRDs
   - Fill in step-by-step patterns for feature types
   - Include code examples
   - Scope to source paths if applicable:
     ```yaml
     ---
     paths:
       - "src/**/*"
       - "lib/**/*"
     ---
     ```

   **`quality-standards.md`**:
   - Aggregated quality requirements from all PRDs
   - Fill in performance baselines from PRDs
   - Fill in security requirements from PRDs
   - Create project-specific checklist

   **Path-scoping guidance**: Add `paths` frontmatter when a rule only applies to specific file types or directories. This reduces context noise — Claude only loads the rule when working on matching files. Use brace expansion for concise patterns: `*.{ts,tsx}`, `src/{api,routes}/**/*`.

5. **Update manifest with generation tracking**:

   Store filenames **relative** to `$RULES_DIR` so the registry remains stable when `generated_rules_path` changes. The path itself lives in `structure.generated_rules_path`; the keys here are bare filenames (without directory).

   ```json
   {
     "generated": {
       "rules": {
         "architecture-patterns.md": {
           "source": "docs/prds/*",
           "source_hash": "sha256:...",
           "generated_at": "[ISO timestamp]",
           "plugin_version": "3.0.0",
           "content_hash": "sha256:...",
           "status": "current"
         },
         "testing-strategies.md": { ... },
         "implementation-guides.md": { ... },
         "quality-standards.md": { ... }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Update task registry**:

   Update the task registry entry in `docs/blueprint/manifest.json`:

   ```bash
   jq --arg now "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
     --argjson processed "${PRDS_READ:-0}" \
     --argjson created "${RULES_GENERATED:-0}" \
     '.task_registry["generate-rules"].last_completed_at = $now |
      .task_registry["generate-rules"].last_result = "success" |
      .task_registry["generate-rules"].context.source_prd_hashes = ($source_prd_hashes // {}) |
      .task_registry["generate-rules"].stats.runs_total = ((.task_registry["generate-rules"].stats.runs_total // 0) + 1) |
      .task_registry["generate-rules"].stats.items_processed = $processed |
      .task_registry["generate-rules"].stats.items_created = $created' \
     docs/blueprint/manifest.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json docs/blueprint/manifest.json
   ```

   For `source_prd_hashes`, compute `sha256sum` of each PRD file and pass as a JSON object via `--argjson`.

7. **Report**:
   ```
   Rules generated from PRDs!

   Created in $RULES_DIR (configured via structure.generated_rules_path):
   - architecture-patterns.md
   - testing-strategies.md
   - implementation-guides.md
   - quality-standards.md

   PRDs analyzed:
   - docs/prds/[List PRD files]

   Key patterns extracted:
   - Architecture: [Brief summary]
   - Testing: [Brief summary]
   - Implementation: [Brief summary]
   - Quality: [Brief summary]

   Rules are immediately available - Claude auto-discovers them based on context!
   ```

8. **Prompt for next action** (use AskUserQuestion):
   ```
   question: "Rules generated. What would you like to do next?"
   options:
     - label: "Generate workflow commands (Recommended)"
       description: "Create /project:continue and /project:test-loop commands"
     - label: "Update CLAUDE.md"
       description: "Regenerate project overview document with new rules"
     - label: "Review generated rules"
       description: "I'll examine and refine the rules manually"
     - label: "I'm done for now"
       description: "Exit - rules are already available"
   ```

   **Based on selection:**
   - "Generate workflow commands" -> Run `/blueprint:generate-commands`
   - "Update CLAUDE.md" -> Run `/blueprint:claude-md`
   - "Review generated rules" -> Show rule file locations and exit
   - "I'm done for now" -> Exit

**Important**:
- Rules should be markdown files with clear headings
- Keep rule content specific and focused
- Include code examples to make patterns concrete
- Reference PRD sections for traceability
- Rules should be actionable, not just documentation

**Error Handling**:
- If no PRDs found -> Guide user to derive plans first (`/blueprint:derive-plans`)
- If PRDs incomplete -> Generate rules with TODO markers for missing sections
- If rules already exist and modified -> Offer to backup before overwriting
