# LaunchServices Health (macOS)

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use something else when... |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| `launchservicesd` is at sustained high CPU | General process forensics — use `ps`/`top` directly |
| GUI feels sluggish after weeks of uptime | The machine actually hung — see `macos-incident-postmortem` |
| Quantifying LS DB bloat (size, bundle count, claim count) | Checking app launch failures — use `system_profiler SPApplicationsDataType` |
| Deciding whether `lsregister` rebuild is warranted | First-time install setup — use `configure-plugin` |

## Platform Guard

This skill is **macOS-only**. The `lsregister` binary, `launchservicesd` daemon, and the LaunchServices database are Darwin-specific. Refuse to act if `uname -s` is not `Darwin`.

```bash
test "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin" || { echo "macos-plugin: not Darwin, refusing"; exit 1; }
```

## Core Expertise

LaunchServices is the macOS subsystem that maps documents and URL schemes to applications. State is held by `launchservicesd` and persisted to a binary database. Two failure modes matter:

1. **DB bloat** — over months of uptime and app churn (Homebrew updates, Xcode reinstalls, Wine/CrossOver bottle creation, Electron app upgrades), the DB accumulates stale bundle records and duplicate claims. The bigger the DB, the slower `lsregister -dump` runs and the more memory `launchservicesd` holds.
2. **Daemon wedge** — `launchservicesd` can spin at high CPU when a misbehaving process repeatedly registers/unregisters bundles. WindowServer makes synchronous XPC calls into `launchservicesd` for icon and document-handler lookups; a wedged daemon manifests as a frozen GUI.

The diagnostic answer is always: **measure first, rebuild only if warranted**. Rebuild (`lsregister -kill -r ...`) takes minutes, makes every app's "open with" disappear briefly, and rebuilds the DB from scratch — only do it when the metrics justify it.

### Where the bits live

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister` | The `lsregister` CLI — not on `$PATH`, must be invoked by absolute path |
| `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.PersistentURLTranslator/` | Per-user persisted state |
| `/var/folders/*/0/com.apple.LaunchServices*` | LS cache directories (varies by macOS version) |

## Quick Snapshot

The reference script `ls-stats` produces a one-page health snapshot. Install at `~/.local/bin/ls-stats` (mode 0755):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ls-stats: macOS LaunchServices DB + launchservicesd health snapshot
set -euo pipefail

[ "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin" ] || { echo "not Darwin" >&2; exit 1; }

LSREG=/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister
PID=$(pgrep -x launchservicesd) || { echo "launchservicesd not running" >&2; exit 1; }

DUMP=$(mktemp); trap 'rm -f "$DUMP"' EXIT
"$LSREG" -dump >"$DUMP" 2>/dev/null

echo "=== launchservicesd ==="
ps -o pid,rss,etime,command -p "$PID" | sed 's/^/  /'

echo
echo "=== LaunchServices DB ==="
wc -c <"$DUMP" | awk '{printf "  size:    %d bytes (%.1f MB)\n", $1, $1/1048576}'
printf "  bundles: %d\n" "$(grep -c '^bundle id:' "$DUMP")"
printf "  claims:  %d\n" "$(grep -c '^claim '    "$DUMP")"
printf "  records: %d\n" "$(grep -c '^----'      "$DUMP")"

echo
printf "=== Diagnostic reports ===\n  launchservicesd CPU events: %d\n" \
  "$(ls /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ 2>/dev/null | grep -c launchservicesd)"

echo
echo "=== Uptime ==="
uptime | awk '{print "  " $0}'
```

The script prints four blocks: daemon process state (RSS, etime), DB size and counts, recent CPU diagnostic-report count, and current uptime. All numbers are absolute — interpret them against the baseline thresholds below.

## Interpreting the Snapshot

### launchservicesd RSS

| RSS (KB) | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| < 50 000 (~50 MB) | Healthy |
| 50 000 – 150 000 | Normal for active use |
| 150 000 – 400 000 | Bloated; consider rebuild |
| > 400 000 (~400 MB) | Pathological; rebuild warranted |

### Daemon `etime` (elapsed time since launch)

`launchservicesd` is launched once per boot and lives until reboot. `etime` close to `uptime` is normal. `etime` significantly less than `uptime` means the daemon was relaunched mid-session — usually after a crash; check Diagnostic Reports.

### DB size

| Size | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| < 5 MB | Normal |
| 5 – 20 MB | Healthy heavy-app workstation |
| 20 – 50 MB | Bloated; rebuild improves things |
| > 50 MB | Pathological |

### Bundle / claim / record counts

There is no absolute threshold — these matter relative to the **expected** number of installed apps. Useful sanity check:

```bash
ls /Applications /Applications/Utilities ~/Applications 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

If `bundle id:` count is 5x or more above the visible-`.app` count, the DB has stale records.

### Diagnostic-report CPU events

`/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/launchservicesd-*.cpu_resource.diag` files indicate the daemon hit a CPU threshold (typically 80% sustained for 90s). Each file is one event. Recent volume:

```bash
find /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports -name 'launchservicesd*.cpu_resource.diag' -mtime -7 | wc -l
```

| Count (last 7 days) | Meaning |
|---------------------|---------|
| 0 | Normal |
| 1 – 3 | Notable; monitor |
| 4+ | Pattern; likely a misbehaving registrar — investigate |

## Rebuild Procedure

Rebuild **only** when the snapshot shows multiple red flags. The rebuild takes 1–10 minutes depending on app count.

```bash
# Rebuild the LaunchServices database
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister \
  -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
```

What the flags do:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `-kill` | Reset the existing database first |
| `-r` | Recursively scan for bundles to register |
| `-domain local` | `/Applications` |
| `-domain system` | `/System/Applications`, `/System/Library` |
| `-domain user` | `~/Applications`, `~/Library/Application Support` |

Side effects:

- "Open With" submenus regenerate (a few seconds of "no apps available")
- Default-app preferences are preserved (stored separately)
- The Dock badge and icon caches are NOT affected
- A new `launchservicesd` process is spawned; PID changes

### After rebuild

Re-run `ls-stats` to confirm RSS, DB size, and counts dropped.

## Common Patterns

### Snapshot before/after a rebuild

```bash
ls-stats > /tmp/ls-before.txt
"$LSREG" -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
ls-stats > /tmp/ls-after.txt
diff -u /tmp/ls-before.txt /tmp/ls-after.txt
```

### Track DB growth across boots

Append a snapshot to a logbook on each session:

```bash
{ date -Iseconds; ls-stats; echo "---"; } >> ~/.local/state/launchservices.log
```

Plot or grep over time to see whether DB size is monotonically growing.

### Identify the registrar driving CPU

When `launchservicesd` is hot and you suspect a specific app:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'process == "launchservicesd"' --style syslog | head -200
```

Look for repeated `bundle id` or `path` strings — that's the offender.

### Check for bottle-creation amplification

Wine/CrossOver bottle creation registers hundreds of `.exe`-as-bundle entries. Count them:

```bash
"$LSREG" -dump 2>/dev/null | grep -c -i 'wineprefix\|bottle'
```

A 4-digit answer is the smoking gun.

## Justfile Recipe

```just
[doc('Quantify LaunchServices DB and launchservicesd state (macOS)')]
[macos]
ls-stats:
    @~/.local/bin/ls-stats
```

The `[macos]` attribute (just 1.34+) skips the recipe on non-Darwin. On older just versions, drop the attribute and let the script's `uname -s` check do the gating.

## Agentic Optimizations

| Context | Command |
|---------|---------|
| One-line size | `$LSREG -dump 2>/dev/null \| wc -c \| awk '{printf "%.1f MB\n", $1/1048576}'` |
| RSS only | `ps -o rss= -p "$(pgrep -x launchservicesd)"` |
| Bundle count | `$LSREG -dump 2>/dev/null \| grep -c '^bundle id:'` |
| Recent CPU events | `find /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports -name 'launchservicesd*.cpu_resource.diag' -mtime -7 \| wc -l` |
| Daemon uptime vs system uptime | `ps -o etime= -p "$(pgrep -x launchservicesd)"; uptime` |

## Quick Reference

### Key paths

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/System/.../Support/lsregister` | The CLI |
| `/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` | CPU and crash diag files |
| `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.PersistentURLTranslator/` | Per-user state |

### Useful flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-dump` | Print the entire DB to stdout |
| `-kill -r -domain ...` | Rebuild |
| `-h` | List all flags (undocumented elsewhere) |
| `-f <bundle>` | Force-register a single bundle |
| `-u <bundle>` | Unregister a bundle |

### Indicator thresholds (rough)

| Metric | Healthy | Bloated | Rebuild |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| DB size | < 5 MB | 20–50 MB | > 50 MB |
| Daemon RSS | < 50 MB | 150–400 MB | > 400 MB |
| Bundle count vs visible apps | 1–2x | 3–5x | > 5x |
| CPU diag events / 7 days | 0 | 1–3 | 4+ |

## Error Handling

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `lsregister: command not found` | Not on `$PATH` by design | Use the full `/System/.../Support/lsregister` path |
| `lsregister -dump` exits non-zero with stderr | Permissions or DB corruption | Capture stderr separately; rebuild may resolve it |
| `pgrep -x launchservicesd` returns nothing | Daemon crashed and not yet relaunched | Check Diagnostic Reports; force a relaunch with `lsregister -kill -r ...` |
| Rebuild appears to hang | Indexing many app bundles is genuinely slow | Wait — typical 1–10 min depending on app count |
| Sudden RSS jump after Homebrew upgrade | Many bundles re-registered at once | Expected; will settle within minutes |
