Display feature tracker statistics, phase progress, and completion summary.

## When to Use This Skill

| Use this skill when... | Use blueprint-feature-tracker-sync instead when... |
|---|---|
| You want a read-only view of completion stats and phase progress | You need to reconcile TODO.md with the tracker (writes) |
| You want to see PRD coverage and ready-to-start work | You want to drain WO entries via `--drain-wave` |
| You're checking blocked features without modifying state | You want to recalculate completion percentages |
| You want a quick "where are we?" snapshot | Use feature-tracking instead for low-level FR-code edits |

## Steps

1. **Check if feature tracking is enabled**:
   - Look for `docs/blueprint/feature-tracker.json`
   - If not found, report:
     ```
     Feature tracking not enabled in this project.
     Run `/blueprint:init` and enable feature tracking to get started.
     ```

2. **Load tracker data**:
   - Read `feature-tracker.json`
   - Extract project name, source document, last_updated
   - Get statistics section
   - Get phase information
   - Get PRD status

3. **Calculate derived metrics** (if not in statistics):
   - Count features by status at all nesting levels
   - Calculate completion percentage
   - Count features per phase
   - Count PRDs by status

4. **Display status report**:
   ```
   Feature Tracker Status
   ======================
   Project: {project}
   Source: {source_document}
   Last Updated: {last_updated}

   Overall Progress:
   ==================
   {progress_bar} {completion_percentage}% ({complete}/{total_features})

   Complete:     {complete}
   Partial:      {partial}
   In Progress:  {in_progress}
   Not Started:  {not_started}
   Blocked:      {blocked}

   Phase Progress:
   ===============
   {For each phase:}
   Phase {N}: {name}
   Status: {status}
   Features: {complete}/{total} complete

   PRD Coverage:
   =============
   {For each PRD:}
   {PRD_NAME}: {status}
     Features: {features_implemented count}
     {If tests_passing:} Tests: {tests_passing} passing

   {If blocked features exist:}
   Blocked Features:
   =================
   {For each blocked feature:}
   - {FR code}: {name}
     Reason: {implementation.notes or "No reason documented"}

   {If not_started features exist and count <= 10:}
   Ready to Start:
   ===============
   {List first 10 not_started features by phase order}
   - {FR code}: {name} (Phase {N})

   {If any feature has non-empty implemented_by (monorepo portfolio, v3.3.0+):}
   Portfolio Features (linked to child workspaces):
   ================================================
   {For each portfolio feature with implemented_by:}
   - {FR code}: {name} — derived status: {status}
     Implemented by:
     {For each link:}
       - {link.workspace}/{link.ref} → {status from child feature-tracker}

   {If top-level "workspaces" summary present:}
   Workspace Rollups:
   ==================
   {For each workspace key:}
   - {path}: {complete}/{total} ({completion_percentage}%) [last synced: {last_synced_at}]
   ```

4a. **Resolve portfolio links** (v3.3.0+):
   For each feature with non-empty `implemented_by`, open each referenced child
   `<workspace>/docs/blueprint/feature-tracker.json` and look up the `ref` FR to
   obtain its current status. Warn (do not fail) on missing workspaces or
   refs; suggest `/blueprint:workspace-scan` + `/blueprint:feature-tracker-sync`.

5. **Display visual progress bar**:
   Create ASCII progress bar:
   ```
   [##########----------] 52.4%
   ```
   - `#` for complete percentage
   - `-` for remaining
   - 20 characters wide

6. **Check for staleness**:
   - If `last_updated` is more than 7 days old, warn:
     ```
     Note: Tracker hasn't been synced in {N} days.
     Run `/blueprint:feature-tracker-sync` to update.
     ```

7. **Prompt for next action** (use AskUserQuestion):
   Build options dynamically based on state:
   - If stale → Include "Sync feature tracker"
   - If not_started features exist → Include "Start next feature"
   - If in_progress features exist → Include "Continue current work"
   - Always include "View detailed breakdown" and "Exit"

   ```
   question: "What would you like to do?"
   options:
     {Dynamic options based on state}
     - label: "Sync feature tracker" (if stale)
       description: "Update tracker from project state"
     - label: "Start next feature" (if not_started exist)
       description: "Begin work on the next pending feature"
     - label: "Continue current work" (if in_progress exist)
       description: "Resume work on in-progress features"
     - label: "View features by status"
       description: "List all features filtered by status"
     - label: "Exit"
       description: "Done viewing status"
   ```

   **Based on selection:**
   - "Sync" → Run `/blueprint:feature-tracker-sync`
   - "Start next" → Show next not_started feature details, suggest starting
   - "Continue" → Show in_progress features, suggest continuing
   - "View by status" → Ask which status, then list matching features
   - "Exit" → End command

**Example Output**:
```
